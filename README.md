Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the world_population_dataset, focusing on creating visualizations to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this task is **world_population_dataset**, encompassing population records from 2001 to 2022.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I undertook the following steps:

- **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset, addressing them as needed.
- **Visualization**: Created bar charts and stacked charts to visually explore the distribution of variables across different categories or years.

### Highlights of the Task:
Ranking of countries by male and female populations in 2022.

### Conclusion
This EDA process has yielded valuable insights into the dataset, providing a foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
